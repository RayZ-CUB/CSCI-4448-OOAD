Hello, My name is Rui Zhang. This semester I'm going to use 
Intellij for CSCI-4448 OOAD coding assignment. My java version is openjdk version "18.0.2.1" 2022-08-18
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 18.0.2.1+1-1)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 18.0.2.1+1-1, mixed mode, sharing).

The first programming assignment is more time consuming than I expected. I spend some time to set up environment. 
This is also my first Java program. I do enjoy solving problem, it helped me refresh my mindset a lot.
